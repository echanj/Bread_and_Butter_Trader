## üìù Overview

Approximately a year ago, I embarked on a journey to transition my skills into the field of algorithmic trading. This effort has resulted in the development of a fully automated backtesting and screening engine, integrating a diverse set of concepts and tools. Key areas covered in this system include:

- **Generalized Pairs Trading**
- **Cross-sectional Analysis**
- **PCA and Factor Modeling**
- **Mean Reversion and OU Processes**
- **Kelly Criterion Optimization**
  
The core of this framework functions as a "Trading Automaton," simulating trades across historical time series data and identifying profitable Z-score signals through metrics such as the Sharpe ratio.

### Core Inspiration

The methodologies are largely inspired by Dr. Ernest Chan's work and the influential paper, "Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Market" by Marco Avellaneda and Jeong-Hyun Lee. This system simulates lower-frequency trading strategies, allowing for selective, discretionary decision-making rather than relying on full automation.

### Technical Analysis Enhancements

The system leverages additional statistical tools to refine its suggestions:
- **ARIMA**
- **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**
- **MSM (Markov Switching Models)**

While integrating large language models (LLMs) for further analysis is feasible, it has not been a primary focus at this stage.

The result? An interactive, intuitive approach to algorithmic trading‚Äî"Bread and Butter Trading"‚Äîbringing together robust quantitative analysis with a practical, hands-on decision-making approach.
