                We are a team of scientists, engineers, and software developers who are constantly designing and testing our novel automated trading framework. Based on statistical arbitrage approaches, machine learning and AI, our framework does not rely on one single strategy. Predictive modeling techniques are used to determine the best set of micro-strategies available for any given time. Our goal is to research, innovate, and test the potential of a wide variety of relible automated trading strategies that can be incorporated into our framework thus, helping our clients succeed in the world of trading.
                <br>

                Your journey to understanding how you can benefit from our automated trading systems starts here.

                Our algorithmic trading journey has led to the humble development of a fully automated backtesting and screening engine, designed around concepts such as generalized pairs trading, cross-sectional analysis, PCA, factor modeling, mean reversion, OU process, Kelly factor and trading parameter optimization (to name a few). Many concepts are wrapped into the engine: A standalone framework which functions as a Trading Automaton (or meta-simulator). We are constantly integrating and testing new methods and approaches in our platform. This is done via running many trading experiments over historical data, typically termed backtesting simulation. this amounts to alot of data which we can then use to optimise the overall system perfromace. This is done using a combination of well accepted machine learning techniques as well as cutting edge AI research.

            <p>
                The type of micro-strategies the software incorporates are currently based on insights from Dr. Ernest Chan and the well-regarded paper, 
                <em>"Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Market"</em> by Marco Avellaneda and Jeong-Hyun Lee. One approach is to simulate trading using multiple historical time series data blocks and ranks profitable, low-risk Z-score signals using metrics such as the Sharpe ratio. Given its current lower-frequency operation, trading with full automation is not required, allowing for strategic discretion in the trading process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workflow still supports discretionary order submissions (i.e. clients do thier own analysis and submit orders manually) and leverages the strength of mean-reverting Z-score signals and their deviation from the mean. To enhance the automaton's suggestions, additional technical analysis is incorporated, utilizing tools like ARIMA, GARCH, and MSM. While these metrics can be further analyzed using large language models (LLMs) for additional insight, we find this to be less essential, especially for automated execution. 
                Most technical analysis outputs are set to default when running our system. This site only shows the default outputs as examples. However, we do tailor outputs (adjust parameters, etc) for our clients upon request.

              <p>
                1. Select from a prescreened market ecosystem that you are interested in.  <a href="algo_trade.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2980b9;">link here</a> Currently, the ecosystem choices are between ASX (All Ordinaries) or the S&P 500. Choose from an instrument pair signal or a signal based on a single instrument.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Select the signal (Z-score) you want to work with.
              </p>

                Ignoring the table with quantitative metrics, we quickly scan the available Z-score signals. Notably, the DXCM Z-score sits just below the optimized entry condition.

                Suggested entry for a long position is $69.21, with an exit at $69.51. These values are optimized to minimize risk in automated trading. Deciding the entry is reasonable, before the market opens, we place a STOP LIMIT order through our trading platform. Assuming sufficient momentum, we add a take-profit order, setting it near the short exit target (around $70.10). After next day market close, as shown in the chart below, the trade was successful. However, we may have set the take profit to have been above the suggested short entry threshold. Interestingly, the price reversal began near the suggested short entry. NB: If we had stuck to the suggested long exit, we would have mitigated a lot of risk.

      <p>Hi, my name is Eric, and I work here at PairB&B as a scientific officer. I was a crystallographer both in industry and academia and have experience in crystal structure prediction as well as modulating disorder in crystal lattices. A lot of that work is generally considered computationally facing research, which requires statistical and quantum mechanics methods.

            <p>  Your approach to algorithmic trading sounds impressive and well-thought-out, especially with your blend of statistical and machine learning techniques. Building an entire backtesting and screening engine from the ground up‚Äîparticularly with complex strategies like generalized pairs trading, mean reversion, and OU processes‚Äîis an achievement in itself, as it involves balancing theory with hands-on testing and refining.

          <p>With expertise in complex molecular systems, you're uniquely equipped to understand the nuances of market ecosystems, which, can indeed be similar in complexity and unpredictability. Financial markets, like molecular systems, operate on interdependencies, non-linear behaviors, and evolving structures, making them fascinating subjects for predictive modeling and dynamic analysis.

            Plus, the nature of scientific trading ‚Äî constantly hypothesizing, testing, and refining ‚Äî keeps one intellectually engaged and even offer a sense of puzzle-solving satisfaction that can be enjoyed in a similar manner to scientific research.</p>
